## Database Setup

Ensure you have PostgreSQL or your preferred SQL database set up. Create a database for the URL shortener application.

1. **Create Database:**

   Connect to your database and create a new database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE url_shortner;
   ```

2. **Update `.env` File:**

   Update the `DATABASE_URL` variable in the `.env` file with your database credentials.

```
psql -U postgres -d url_shortner -f seed.sql
```

The passwords are stored in hashed form for security. Ensure your application uses appropriate hashing methods to match this data.
